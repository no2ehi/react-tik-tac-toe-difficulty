This game is made using Reack Hooks.

here are some ideas for improvements that you could make to the tic-tac-toe game, listed in order of increasing difficulty:
1. [✔️] For the current move only, show “You are at move #…” instead of a button
2. [✔️] Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
3. [✔️] Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
4. [✔️] When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win (and when no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw).
5. [✔️] Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
